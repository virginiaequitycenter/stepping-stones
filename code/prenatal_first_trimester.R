# This data was not available in an easily downloadable form for an extended period.
# Instead we copied the data from two sources and compiled them in a spreadsheet.
# Because manual curation is error prone, this process was completed by two teams
# and the resulting data sets compared. Differences were reinvestigated by the 
# instructor and corrected.
