## Democratization of Data

The [Democratization of Data Initiative](https://virginiaequitycenter.org/democratization-data) centers community-driven partnership to provide advocates as well as civic-and private-sector leaders with data and metrics, contextualized analysis, interactive maps and data visualizations, and narrative storytelling as a resource in pursuit of equity throughout the region.

</div>

**Course goals**

* Make progress on projects that advance social justice and policy understanding in collaboration with community partners.
* Practice working with data to answer pressing questions, including finding, cleaning, and understanding data; exploring, analyzing, modeling data; visualizing, contextualizing, and communicating data; with care and humility and respect for the affected partners and communities throughout.
* Develop experience in data workflows that support ethical data science, including processes for working collaboratively, openly, inclusively, and reproducibly.


## Stepping Stones Report

Steppings Stones: A Report on Community Well-Being of Children and Families in the Charlottesville/Albemarle Area

<div align="center">
[![](images/stepstonescover.png){width=25%}](https://www.charlottesville.gov/1623/Stepping-Stones-Report)
</div>

* Produced by the City of Charlottesville Department of Human Services
* A compilation of ~ 40 measures to track community and youth well-being
* Began as a project of the [Commission for Children and Families](https://www.cvillepedia.org/Commission_on_Children_and_Families) in 2000


# Principles

How do we enact equity and ethics in our data work?

## Open Knowledge

* Open (authoritative) sources when possible
    - Challenges of making ad hoc data requests; mediated sources no longer available
    - Generalizability to other places
    - Example: VDSS reports on [foster care](https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/reports/children/fc.cgi)
    - Example: VSS [CPS reports](https://cpsaccountability.dss.virginia.gov/index-historical-reports.html)
* Open software ![](images/heartR.gif){width=10%}; with learning curve ![](images/breakR.gif){width=10%}
* Open access, ideally online (in multiple places) and in printed form


## Reproducibility and Reuse
<div class="columns-2">
Shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/)

* Generate processes that are repeatable, preferably by a computer (via scripting); examples [VDSS](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/children_fostercare.R), [VDH](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/low_birth_weight.R)
* Generate proceses that are understandable, preferably by a human (via commenting), examples [VDOE](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/ontime_grad_rates.R), [SAIPE](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/child_poverty.R)

</div>

## Transparency and Documentation
<div class="columns-2">
Facilitate validation

* Re-collection of past data when possible; example [BOE](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/voter_reg.R)
* Redundancy for data that requires manual curation; example [DCV reports](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/stepping-stones/blob/main/code/compare_alcohol_arrests.R)
* Documentation of choices for checking by others

</div>

## Data don't speak for themselves

Who's view is communicated in the presentation of the data? (an aside)

[![](images/wp_coviddeaths_race.png){width=45%}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/10/19/covid-deaths-us-race/) [![](images/pew_coviddeaths_party.png){width=45%}](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/03/the-changing-political-geography-of-covid-19-over-the-last-two-years/)

## Contextualization

Some categories we're working to address for each measure...

* Why is this important?
* How is this measured?
* Source of the data
* Description of trend
* Further considerations (data settings)
* Who is this data about?

## Next steps

* Students submit their final drafts tomorrow!
* Equity Center team will check, integrate, complete
* A smaller student team will begin work of generating a selection of measures disaggregated by race
* DHS will work with us to convene a set of stakeholders for pre-release review and feedback
